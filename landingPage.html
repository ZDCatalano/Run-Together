        <p class="lead"><h5>Run Together is a social networking app where runners can go to find routes, races, reviews, and community. This app strives to strengthen the social fabric of the running community through run groups, product reviews, and sharing goals.</h5>
        <br>
            Finding people to run with can be challenging especially when you are beginning to start your running journey. This app will help you find people training for the same races as you so you can run and train with a common goal in mind.
        <br>
            Finding good running gear can be difficult but with run together, you will have access to gearr reviews ranging from shoes to watches.
            <br>
            Run Together give you the ability to post your goals and your progression of achieving those goals. This allows for people to comment on your post and motivate you.

        When beginning to design this application, I thought to when I began running. I thought back to the lack of community that I felt whether it be for running gorups or someone to help motivate me for my first 5k. When talking with friends and family who run, I heard common answers as:
          <br>
          "I wish I had people to run with"
          <br>
          "I need more help picking out a good running shoe"
          <br>
          "How do I choose good races around the area"
          <br>
          All of these questions or concerns help move the direction of Run Together from a basic social network to share runs, in to a hub for all types of running information.

        <h4>Here is the design challenge worksheet we did in class.</h4>  
          
          
        What is the problem you’re trying to solve?
        <br>  
        I am trying to solve the lack of social network within the running community.
        <br>
        1)	Take a stab at framing it as a design question. 
          How can I improve the sense of community within runners around this area?
        <br>  
2)	Now state the ultimate impact you’re trying to have. 
The ultimate impact of what I am creating is to connect runners to other runners to have resources, support, and grow the sense of community within the sport.
          <br>
3)	What are some possible solutions to your problem?
Gear reviews, running groups to join, group runs to go on, 
<br>
4)	 Finally, write down some of the context and constraints that you’re facing. 
They could be geographic, technological, time-based, or have to do with the population you’re trying to reach. 
          <br>
5)	Does your original question need a tweak? Try it again.           
No
          <br>
6)	Who do you want to help?

Runners who have access to a mobile phone application.
<br>
7)	What do they want to do?

They want to have more connections for a multitude of purposes.
<br>
8)	What is their frustration (the current problem)?

How there is not a social network app that is currently fulfilling the needs stated above. 
<br>
9)	What would be a possible solution (social fabric + technology)?
Run Together: The social hub for everything running.

        <h4>Example Persona</h4>
        
          Name: Dan Krautle
          <br>
Age: 50 years old
          <br>
Gender: Male
          <br>
Job: Business Management for a small companyJob: Business Management for a small manufacturing company
          <br>
Behavioral Patterns: Good leadership skills. Does not like to interact with people outside of work. Interested in running, endurance events, triathlons, and sport equipment.
          <br>
Dan likes to run but goes in phases due to the lack of community he feels when not training for specific races or events. Dan wants to know how people feel about running shoes before he purchases them. Dan would like to run alone but finds it difficult to get out of the door to train.
          <br>
The goal with Dan interacting with Run Together would be to help him find a running group to start training more, and look at shoe reviews.
